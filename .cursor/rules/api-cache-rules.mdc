# Cache Management Rules

## cache expiraton times for each endpoint
- /tides/stations/geojson - forever. does not change
- /tides/stations/8410834/predictions - 24 hours
- /waves/44098/forecast - based on model run timing - and expires only when a new model run is available [model_run_service.py](mdc:features/common/services/model_run_service.py)
- /waves/v2/44098/forecast - based on model run timing - and expires only when a new model run is available @model_run_service.py


## Key Structure
- Cache keys MUST follow format: `{feature}_{type}:{station_id}`
  - Example: `wind_forecast:44098`, `wave_forecast:44098`
  - Never use generic feature names like "data" or "info"

## Expiration Times
- Model forecasts: 14400s (4 hours) - matches GFS model run frequency
- Current conditions: 900s (15 minutes) - real-time data
- Static data (geojson): No expiration
- Never use arbitrary expiration times

## Key Builder Functions
```python
def feature_cache_key_builder(
    func,
    namespace: Optional[str] = "",
    *args, 
    **kwargs,
) -> str:
    """Standard cache key builder for station-specific endpoints."""
    station_id = kwargs.get("station_id", "")
    return f"{namespace}:{station_id}"
```

## Decorator Usage
```python
@cached(
    namespace="feature_type",  # e.g. wind_forecast, wave_forecast
    expire=STANDARD_EXPIRE,    # Use constants from above
    key_builder=feature_cache_key_builder
)
```

## Cache Namespaces
- Forecasts: `{feature}_forecast`
- Current data: `{feature}_current`
- Static data: `{feature}_static`

## Cache Invalidation
- Cache invalidates automatically on expiration
- No manual invalidation except during deployments
- Each station must have its own cache entry
- Each endpoint type must have its own namespace
