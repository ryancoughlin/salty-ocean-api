description: when naming, looking up keys, variables from data or types
globs:

# do not make up keys or variables. or check for `AB` and `ab` 
- never guess types or add conditions to checkl for `station_id` or `id`
- pick one the app uses or ask to clarify.
- NEVER guess or add in many ways to do this. 

- when naming variables, keys or objects. be semantic, primitive while clear. Avoid `DataType` and `DDAta` â€“ prefer `StationForecast` or `WindForecastHour`
